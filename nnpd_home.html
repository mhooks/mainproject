            <p>Nature Photography Day was created in 2006 and The North American Nature Photography Association put it in McGraw-Hill's reference work, "Chase's Calendar of Events". The idea behind it is to promote the protection of the environment. Since then, millions of people across the world celebrate by enjoying nature photography by taking images, going to galleries, and sharing the beautiful world they see around them.</p></div>
